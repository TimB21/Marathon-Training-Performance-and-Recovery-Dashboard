## Overview:
This project is a personal tool designed to analyze and improve running performance by tracking and visualizing various metrics such as pace, heart rate, distance, and performance scores. The analysis provides a holistic view of my training patterns, offering insights into running efficiency, cardiovascular health, and training progress over time. By calculating key performance indicators such as performance scores, training stress scores (TSS), and analyzing cumulative mileage, this project helps optimize training plans, prevent injuries, and balance load for long-term improvement. 

## Key Features:
### 1. **Pace Analysis**:
   - Evaluate trends in running pace over different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Track progress in speed and endurance, and identify areas of improvement.
   - Visualizations to show pace distribution and variations across sessions.

### 2. **Heart Rate Monitoring**:
   - Analyze heart rate patterns to assess cardiovascular fitness and training intensity.
   - Visualize daily or cumulative average heart rate to ensure safe training zones.
   - Monitor recovery times and overall cardiovascular efficiency.

### 3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Custom performance score that combines **pace**, **heart rate**, and **distance** for a holistic evaluation of a training session.
   - Helps identify peak performance days and patterns to adjust training intensity and recovery.

### 4. **Mileage Tracking**:
   - Track **cumulative mileage** to monitor total distance run over time, helping to avoid overtraining or undertraining.
   - **Monthly mileage** tracking to ensure gradual increases and prevent injury.

### 5. **Training Stress Score (TSS)**:
   - Calculate the intensity of training sessions based on duration, pace, and heart rate.
   - Helps assess whether a workout was too easy or too hard and guides the planning of future sessions.

### 6. **Load Balancing**:
   - Analyze **Acute Training Load (ATL)** and **Chronic Training Load (CTL)** to find the optimal balance between training intensity and recovery.
   - Visualizations of ATL and CTL trends help prevent overtraining and optimize recovery times.

### 7. Clustering for Pattern Recognition:
   - Machine learning techniques such as clustering are used to identify patterns in running sessions.  
   - Group training sessions into clusters based on key metrics (pace, heart rate, distance) to detect trends and help optimize future training decisions.


## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for running the analysis and visualizing results.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and performance score calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for any machine learning models, if applicable.

## Key Achievements:
- **Enhanced Performance Insight**: Created custom performance scores that evaluate an athlete's progress and readiness for future runs.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Provided multi-faceted analysis by combining pace, heart rate, and mileage, allowing for a better understanding of the athleteâ€™s performance training load and recovery.
- **Preventing Injury**: By tracking cumulative mileage, monthly mileage, and load balance, the project helps prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury.
- **Interactive Reporting**: Developed interactive dashboards for dynamic data exploration, which can be used to visualize and monitor running data trends.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrated clustering algorithms to analyze training patterns and optimize performance tracking based on data-driven insights.
